# H1_Extra_beach_chair

2 out of 4 difficulty extra assignment.

Program that outputs 6*9 (54) chairs.
You cant sit on any chair though. Due to corona restrictions, you can only sit on a chair which isnt next to a stranger.
An example of a seat would be "00 " or "000", in which you can sit in the middle.
You cant sit on "10 " or "101". 
This program outputs both the seat arrangment as well as how many seats you can sit on.

The assignment mentions 2 dimentional arrays, however it does not say that it has to be used.
I have not used it in my project, because i saw an easy alternative way, in my own opinion.
